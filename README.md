This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript when interacting with the DOM: attempting to access an element before it has been parsed and added to the DOM tree. The bug.html file contains the erroneous code, which causes a TypeError. The bugSolution.html file provides the corrected version, using an event listener to ensure that the element is accessed only after it's ready.
